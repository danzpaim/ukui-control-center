### Projection
Projection is a software that is allowed to be projected by mobile phones and other Kylin-OS and can be projected to other Kylin OS in Kylin OS desktop environment. It is divided into two parts: receiving terminal and sending terminal. The main interface is shown in Figure.

 ![Fig 14-1 Projection main interface-big](image/mainInterface.png)

 The function buttons at the receiving terminal are in the upper part of the main interface, from top to bottom:

1) Receiving terminal on / off button: after the button is turned on, the current Kylin-OS device can be searched by mobile phone device or other Kylin-OS devices.

2) PIN code function on / off button: after the button is turned on, the PIN code needs to be entered during connection.

 ![Fig 14-2 Enter PIN code interface-big](image/PINCodeinterface.png)

 ![Fig 14-3 Without PIN code interface-big](image/withoutPINCodeinterface.png)

3) Historical device show / hide button: when the button arrow points down, you can see the relevant devices connected to the current Kylin-OS device.

 ![Fig 14-4 Historical device interface-big](image/deviceInterface.png)

The function buttons at the sending terminal are in the lower part of the main interface, including: 

Receiving terminal on / off button: this button is mutually exclusive with the sending terminal on / off button. When the receiving terminal on / off button is turned on, the receiving terminal on / off button needs to be turned off before the sending terminal on / off button can be turned on (the same is true for the receiving terminal turn on / off button). After opening this button, click Find device to pop up the search window, in which the searchable Kylin-OS device at the receiving terminal will be displayed.

 Connection process between mobile phone and Kylin-OS:

1) Open the receiving terminal on / off button (close the sending terminal on / off button first).

2) The mobile phone drop-down menu opens the projection (or mobile phone projection / multi screen collaboration).

 ![Fig 14-5 Phone open projection interface-big](image/phoneOpenProjectionInterface.png)

3) Select the Kylin-OS device to be projected in the mobile search device list.

 ![Fig 14-6 Phone search device interface-big](image/phoneSearchInterface.png)

4) Connect (there are two types: PIN code required and PIN code not required).

![Fig 14-7 Phone enter pin code interface-big](image/phonePINcodeInterface.png)

5) Select the mobile phone model (currently divided into Huawei, Xiaomi and others).

 ![Fig 14-8 Select phone model interface-big](image/chooseTypeInterface.png)

6) Projection interface: the mobile phone screen is displayed in the center of the interface. There are 5 buttons on the right side of the interface, from top to bottom: soft / hard decoding switching button; Full screen / window switching button; Return to parent directory button; Return to the main interface button; Display the application process button;

 ![Fig 14-9 Receiving terminal projection interface-big](image/receiverConnectInterface.png)

**FAQ**

1. If the projection is unsuccessful, you can try to connect again, and the device connected once will be automatically recorded in the history device.

2. Kylin OS and some phones support the control return function (that is, the receiving terminal can indirectly affect the sending terminal by operating the mouse or keyboard).

3. At present only some Huawei phones and Xiaomi phones support Android three button function (the last three buttons on the interface on the right side of the screen). For other models, clicking these buttons may cause unknown problems.

4. The system will use soft decoding by default. At this time, you can manually switch to hard decoding (use hardware to decode video, reduce CPU occupation, and need hardware support).

5. The name of the receiving device can be changed in the screen projection interface. Click the "pen" icon on the right side of the projection screen to enter the modification interface.

![Fig 14-9 Sending terminal name modification interface-big](image/nameChangeInterface.png)

6. When the wireless network card is not inserted, or the wireless network card does not support the connection required for projection, it is necessary to insert the network card or replace the inserted network card.

![Fig 14-10 Projection function unavailable interface(1)-big](image/unUseInterface.png)

7. When the package with wireless projection is not installed or the package version is too low, the projection function will not be displayed in the control panel.

![Fig 14-11 Projection function unavailable interface(2)-big](image/unUseInterface2.png)

8.When used as the sending terminal, it does not support projecting to the receiving terminal of SP1 version.
